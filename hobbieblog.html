    <h2>What is Chess?</h2>
    <p>Chess is a two-player board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares.  Each player has 16 pieces: eight pawns, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, a queen, and a king. The objective of the game is to checkmate your opponent's king, which means putting the king in a position where it is under direct attack (check) and cannot escape.</p>
